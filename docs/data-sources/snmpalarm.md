# citrixadc_snmpalarm (Data Source)

Data source for querying Citrix ADC SNMP alarms. This data source retrieves information about SNMP alarm configurations on the ADC appliance, which control trap message generation based on various system conditions.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "citrixadc_snmpalarm" "example" {
  trapname = "CPU-USAGE"
}

# Output alarm attributes
output "alarm_state" {
  value = data.citrixadc_snmpalarm.example.state
}

output "alarm_threshold" {
  value = data.citrixadc_snmpalarm.example.thresholdvalue
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `trapname` - (Required) Name of the SNMP alarm. This parameter is required for identifying the SNMP alarm and cannot be modified.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the snmpalarm datasource.
* `logging` - Logging status of the alarm. When logging is enabled, the Citrix ADC logs every trap message that is generated for this alarm.
* `normalvalue` - Value for the normal threshold. A trap message is generated if the value of the respective attribute falls to or below this value after exceeding the high threshold.
* `severity` - Severity level assigned to trap messages generated by this alarm. The severity levels are, in increasing order of severity, Informational, Warning, Minor, Major, and Critical. This parameter is useful when you want the Citrix ADC to send trap messages to a trap listener on the basis of severity level.
* `state` - Current state of the SNMP alarm. The Citrix ADC generates trap messages only for SNMP alarms that are enabled. Some alarms are enabled by default, but you can disable them.
* `thresholdvalue` - Value for the high threshold. The Citrix ADC generates an SNMP trap message when the value of the attribute associated with the alarm is greater than or equal to the specified high threshold value.
* `time` - Interval, in seconds, at which the Citrix ADC generates SNMP trap messages when the conditions specified in the SNMP alarm are met. Can be specified for various alarms like SYNFLOOD, HA-VERSION-MISMATCH, CLUSTER-NODE-HEALTH, etc.

## Notes

SNMP alarms are used to configure thresholds and severity levels for trap messages that the ADC sends to monitoring systems. Different alarms monitor different system parameters like CPU usage, memory usage, HA status, and cluster health.
