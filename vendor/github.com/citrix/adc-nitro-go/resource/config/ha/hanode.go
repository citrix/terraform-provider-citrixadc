For example, in an existing HA setup, the Primary node has to be upgraded and this process would take few seconds. During the upgradation, it is possible that the Primary node may suffer from a downtime for a few seconds. However, the Secondary should not take over as the Primary node. Thus, the Secondary node should remain as Secondary even if there is a failure in the Primary node.
		STAYPRIMARY configuration keeps the node in primary state in case if it is healthy, even if the peer node was the primary node initially. If the node with STAYPRIMARY setting (and no peer node) is added to a primary node (which has this node as the peer) then this node takes over as the new primary and the older node becomes secondary. ENABLED state means normal HA operation without any constraints/preferences. DISABLED state disables the normal HA operation of the node.

		The propagated command is executed on the secondary node before it is executed on the primary. If command propagation fails, or if command execution fails on the secondary, the primary node executes the command and logs an error.  Command propagation uses port 3010.
