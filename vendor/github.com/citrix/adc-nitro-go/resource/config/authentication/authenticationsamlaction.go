		InternetProtocol: This is applicable when a principal is authenticated through the use of a provided IP address.
		InternetProtocolPassword: This is applicable when a principal is authenticated through the use of a provided IP address, in addition to a username/password.
		Kerberos: This is applicable when the principal has authenticated using a password to a local authentication authority, in order to acquire a Kerberos ticket.
		MobileOneFactorUnregistered: This indicates authentication of the mobile device without requiring explicit end-user interaction.
		MobileTwoFactorUnregistered: This indicates two-factor based authentication during mobile customer registration process, such as secure device and user PIN.
		MobileOneFactorContract: Reflects mobile contract customer registration procedures and a single factor authentication.
		MobileTwoFactorContract: Reflects mobile contract customer registration procedures and a two-factor based authentication.
		Password: This class is applicable when a principal authenticates using password over unprotected http session.
		PasswordProtectedTransport: This class is applicable when a principal authenticates to an authentication authority through the presentation of a password over a protected session.
		PreviousSession: This class is applicable when a principal had authenticated to an authentication authority at some point in the past using any authentication context.
		X509: This indicates that the principal authenticated by means of a digital signature where the key was validated as part of an X.509 Public Key Infrastructure.
		PGP: This indicates that the principal authenticated by means of a digital signature where the key was validated as part of a PGP Public Key Infrastructure.
		SPKI: This indicates that the principal authenticated by means of a digital signature where the key was validated via an SPKI Infrastructure.
		XMLDSig: This indicates that the principal authenticated by means of a digital signature according to the processing rules specified in the XML Digital Signature specification.
		Smartcard: This indicates that the principal has authenticated using smartcard.
		SmartcardPKI: This class is applicable when a principal authenticates to an authentication authority through a two-factor authentication mechanism using a smartcard with enclosed private key and a PIN.
		SoftwarePKI: This class is applicable when a principal uses an X.509 certificate stored in software to authenticate to the authentication authority.
		Telephony: This class is used to indicate that the principal authenticated via the provision of a fixed-line telephone number, transported via a telephony protocol such as ADSL.
		NomadTelephony: Indicates that the principal is "roaming" and authenticates via the means of the line number, a user suffix, and a password element.
		PersonalTelephony: This class is used to indicate that the principal authenticated via the provision of a fixed-line telephone.
		AuthenticatedTelephony: Indicates that the principal authenticated via the means of the line number, a user suffix, and a password element.
		SecureRemotePassword: This class is applicable when the authentication was performed by means of Secure Remote Password.
		TLSClient: This class indicates that the principal authenticated by means of a client certificate, secured with the SSL/TLS transport.
		TimeSyncToken: This is applicable when a principal authenticates through a time synchronization token.
		Unspecified: This indicates that the authentication was performed by unspecified means.
		Windows: This indicates that Windows integrated authentication is utilized for authentication.
