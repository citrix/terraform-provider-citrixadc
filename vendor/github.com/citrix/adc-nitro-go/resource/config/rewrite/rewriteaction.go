	/**
	* Type of user-defined rewrite action. The information that you provide for, and the effect of, each type are as follows:: 
		* REPLACE <target> <string_builder_expr>. Replaces the string with the string-builder expression.
		* REPLACE_ALL <target> <string_builder_expr> -search <search_expr>. In the request or response specified by <target>, replaces all occurrences of the string defined by <string_builder_expr> with the string defined by <search_expr>.
		* REPLACE_HTTP_RES <string_builder_expr>. Replaces the complete HTTP response with the string defined by the string-builder expression.
		* REPLACE_SIP_RES <target> - Replaces the complete SIP response with the string specified by <target>.
		* INSERT_HTTP_HEADER <header_string_builder_expr> <contents_string_builder_expr>. Inserts the HTTP header specified by <header_string_builder_expr> and header contents specified by <contents_string_builder_expr>.
		* DELETE_HTTP_HEADER <target>. Deletes the HTTP header specified by <target>.
		* CORRUPT_HTTP_HEADER <target>. Replaces the header name of all occurrences of the HTTP header specified by <target> with a corrupted name, so that it will not be recognized by the receiver  Example: MY_HEADER is changed to MHEY_ADER.
		* INSERT_BEFORE <target_expr> <string_builder_expr>. Finds the string specified in <target_expr> and inserts the string in <string_builder_expr> before it.
		* INSERT_BEFORE_ALL <target> <string_builder_expr> -search <search_expr>. In the request or response specified by <target>, locates all occurrences of the string specified in <string_builder_expr> and inserts the string specified in <search_expr> before each.
		* INSERT_AFTER <target_expr> <string_builder_expr>. Finds the string specified in <target_expr>, and inserts the string specified in <string_builder_expr> after it.
		* INSERT_AFTER_ALL <target> <string_builder_expr> -search <search_expr>. In the request or response specified by <target>, locates all occurrences of the string specified by <string_builder_expr> and inserts the string specified by <search_expr> after each.
		* DELETE <target>. Finds and deletes the specified target.
		* DELETE_ALL <target> -search <string_builder_expr>. In the request or response specified by <target>, locates and deletes all occurrences of the string specified by <string_builder_expr>.
		* REPLACE_DIAMETER_HEADER_FIELD <target> <field value>. In the request or response modify the header field specified by <target>. Use Diameter.req.flags.SET(<flag>) or Diameter.req.flags.UNSET<flag> as 'stringbuilderexpression' to set or unset flags.
		* REPLACE_DNS_HEADER_FIELD <target>. In the request or response modify the header field specified by <target>. 
		* REPLACE_DNS_ANSWER_SECTION <target>. Replace the DNS answer section in the response. This is currently applicable for A and AAAA records only. Use DNS.NEW_RRSET_A & DNS.NEW_RRSET_AAAA expressions to configure the new answer section.
		* REPLACE_MQTT <target> <string_builder_expr> : Replace MQTT message fields specified in <target_expr> to the value specified in <string_builder_expr>
		* INSERT_MQTT <string_builder_expr> : Insert the string_builder_expr to an appropriate packet field in the MQTT message.
		* INSERT_AFTER_MQTT <target_expr> <string_builder_expr> : Insert a topic specified in <string_builder_expr> in the MQTT Subscribe or Unsubscribe message after the specified target_expr.
		* INSERT_BEFORE_MQTT <target_expr> <string_builder_expr> : Insert a topic specified in <string_builder_expr> in the MQTT Subscribe or Unsubscribe message before the specified target_expr.
		* DELETE_MQTT <target> : Deletes the specified target in the MQTT message.

	/**
	* Search facility that is used to match multiple strings in the request or response. Used in the INSERT_BEFORE_ALL, INSERT_AFTER_ALL, REPLACE_ALL, and DELETE_ALL action types. The following search types are supported:
		* Text ("text(string)") - A literal string. Example: -search text("hello")
		* Regular expression ("regex(re<delimiter>regular exp<delimiter>)") - Pattern that is used to match multiple strings in the request or response. The pattern may be a PCRE-format regular expression with a delimiter that consists of any printable ASCII non-alphanumeric character except for the underscore (_) and space ( ) that is not otherwise used in the expression. Example: -search regex(re~^hello*~) The preceding regular expression can use the tilde (~) as the delimiter because that character does not appear in the regular expression itself.
		* XPath ("xpath(xp<delimiter>xpath expression<delimiter>)") - An XPath expression to search XML. The delimiter has the same rules as for regex. Example: -search xpath(xp%/a/b%)
		* JSON ("xpath_json(xp<delimiter>xpath expression<delimiter>)") - An XPath expression to search JSON. The delimiter has the same rules as for regex. Example: -search xpath_json(xp%/a/b%)
		NOTE: JSON searches use the same syntax as XPath searches, but operate on JSON files instead of standard XML files.
		* HTML ("xpath_html(xp<delimiter>xpath expression<delimiter>)") - An XPath expression to search HTML. The delimiter has the same rules as for regex. Example: -search xpath_html(xp%/html/body%)
		NOTE: HTML searches use the same syntax as XPath searches, but operate on HTML files instead of standard XML files; HTML 5 rules for the file syntax are used; HTML 4 and later are supported.
		* Patset ("patset(patset)") - A predefined pattern set. Example: -search patset("patset1").
		* Datset ("dataset(dataset)") - A predefined dataset. Example: -search dataset("dataset1").
		* AVP ("avp(avp number)") - AVP number that is used to match multiple AVPs in a Diameter/Radius Message. Example: -search avp(999)
		Note: for all these the TARGET prefix can be used in the replacement expression to specify the text that was selected by the -search parameter, optionally adjusted by the -refineSearch parameter.
		Example: TARGET.BEFORE_STR(",")

		You can use refineSearch only on body expressions, and for the INSERT_BEFORE_ALL, INSERT_AFTER_ALL, REPLACE_ALL, and DELETE_ALL action types.
		Example: -refineSearch 'EXTEND(10, 20).REGEX_SELECT(re~0x[0-9a-zA-Z]+~).
