	/**
	* IP address pattern, in dotted decimal notation, for identifying packets to be accepted by the virtual server. The IP Mask parameter specifies which part of the destination IP address is matched against the pattern.  Mutually exclusive with the IP Address parameter.
		For example, if the IP pattern assigned to the virtual server is 198.51.100.0 and the IP mask is 255.255.240.0 (a forward mask), the first 20 bits in the destination IP addresses are matched with the first 20 bits in the pattern. The virtual server accepts requests with IP addresses that range from 198.51.96.1 to 198.51.111.254.  You can also use a pattern such as 0.0.2.2 and a mask such as 0.0.255.255 (a reverse mask).
		If a destination IP address matches more than one IP pattern, the pattern with the longest match is selected, and the associated virtual server processes the request. For example, if virtual servers vs1 and vs2 have the same IP pattern, 0.0.100.128, but different IP masks of 0.0.255.255 and 0.0.224.255, a destination IP address of 198.51.100.128 has the longest match with the IP pattern of vs1.

		Also available are a number of hashing methods, in which the appliance extracts a predetermined portion of the request, creates a hash of the portion, and then checks whether any previous requests had the same hash value.

		* URLHASH - Create a hash of the request URL (or part of the URL).
		* DOMAINHASH - Create a hash of the domain name in the request (or part of the domain name). The domain name is taken from either the URL or the Host header. If the domain name appears in both locations, the URL is preferred. If the request does not contain a domain name, the load balancing method defaults to LEASTCONNECTION.
		* DESTINATIONIPHASH - Create a hash of the destination IP address in the IP header.
		* SOURCEIPHASH - Create a hash of the source IP address in the IP header.
		* TOKEN - Extract a token from the request, create a hash of the token, and then select the service to which any previous requests with the same token hash value were sent.
		* SRCIPDESTIPHASH - Create a hash of the string obtained by concatenating the source IP address and destination IP address in the IP header.
		* SRCIPSRCPORTHASH - Create a hash of the source IP address and source port in the IP header.
