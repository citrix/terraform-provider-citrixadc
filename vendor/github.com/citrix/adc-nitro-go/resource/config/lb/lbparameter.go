	/**
	* Number of requests, per service, for which to apply the round robin load balancing method before switching to the configured load balancing method, thus allowing services to ramp up gradually to full load. Until the specified number of requests is distributed, the Citrix ADC is said to be implementing the slow start mode (or startup round robin). Implemented for a virtual server when one of the following is true:
		* The virtual server is newly created.
		* One or more services are newly bound to the virtual server.
		* One or more services bound to the virtual server are enabled.
		* The load balancing method is changed.
		This parameter applies to all the load balancing virtual servers configured on the Citrix ADC, except for those virtual servers for which the virtual server-level slow start parameters (New Service Startup Request Rate and Increment Interval) are configured. If the global slow start parameter and the slow start parameters for a given virtual server are not set, the appliance implements a default slow start for the virtual server, as follows:
		* For a newly configured virtual server, the appliance implements slow start for the first 100 requests received by the virtual server.
		* For an existing virtual server, if one or more services are newly bound or newly enabled, or if the load balancing method is changed, the appliance dynamically computes the number of requests for which to implement startup round robin. It obtains this number by multiplying the request rate by the number of bound services (it includes services that are marked as DOWN). For example, if the current request rate is 20 requests/s and ten services are bound to the virtual server, the appliance performs startup round robin for 200 requests.
		Not applicable to a virtual server for which a hash based load balancing method is configured.
