		It cannot be re or xp (reserved for regular and XPath expressions).

	/**
	* Specification of the variable type; one of the following:
		ulong - singleton variable with an unsigned 64-bit value.
		text(value-max-size) - singleton variable with a text string value.
		map(text(key-max-size),ulong,max-entries) - map of text string keys to unsigned 64-bit values.
		map(text(key-max-size),text(value-max-size),max-entries) - map of text string keys to text string values.
		where
		value-max-size is a positive integer that is the maximum number of bytes in a text string value.
		key-max-size is a positive integer that is the maximum number of bytes in a text string key.
		max-entries is a positive integer that is the maximum number of entries in a map variable.
		For a global singleton text variable, value-max-size <= 64000.
		For a global map with ulong values, key-max-size <= 64000.
		For a global map with text values,  key-max-size + value-max-size <= 64000.
		max-entries is a positive integer that is the maximum number of entries in a map variable. This has a theoretical maximum of 2^64-1, but in actual use will be much smaller, considering the memory available for use by the map.
		Example:
		map(text(10),text(20),100) specifies a map of text string keys (max size 10 bytes) to text string values (max size 20 bytes), with 100 max entries.
