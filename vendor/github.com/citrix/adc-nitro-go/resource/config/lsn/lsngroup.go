	* Type of NAT IP address and port allocation (from the bound LSN pools) for subscribers:
		Available options function as follows:
		* Deterministic - Allocate a NAT IP address and a block of ports to each subscriber (of the LSN client bound to the LSN group). The Citrix ADC sequentially allocates NAT resources to these subscribers. The Citrix ADC ADC assigns the first block of ports (block size determined by the port block size parameter of the LSN group) on the beginning NAT IP address to the beginning subscriber IP address. The next range of ports is assigned to the next subscriber, and so on, until the NAT address does not have enough ports for the next subscriber. In this case, the first port block on the next NAT address is used for the subscriber, and so on.  Because each subscriber now receives a deterministic NAT IP address and a block of ports, a subscriber can be identified without any need for logging. For a connection, a subscriber can be identified based only on the NAT IP address and port, and the destination IP address and port. The maximum number of LSN subscribers allowed, globally, is 1 million.  
		* Dynamic - Allocate a random NAT IP address and a port from the LSN NAT pool for a subscriber's connection. If port block allocation is enabled (in LSN pool) and a port block size is specified (in the LSN group), the Citrix ADC allocates a random NAT IP address and a block of ports for a subscriber when it initiates a connection for the first time. The ADC allocates this NAT IP address and a port (from the allocated block of ports) for different connections from this subscriber. If all the ports are allocated (for different subscriber's connections) from the subscriber's allocated port block, the ADC allocates a new random port block for the subscriber.

	/**
	* NAT IP and PORT block allocation policy for Deterministic NAT. Supported Policies are,
		1: PORTS: Port blocks from single NATIP will be allocated to LSN subscribers sequentially. After all blocks are exhausted, port blocks from next NATIP will be allocated and so on.
		2: IPADDRS(Default): One port block from each NATIP will be allocated and once all the NATIPs are over second port block from each NATIP will be allocated and so on.
		To understand better if we assume port blocks of all NAT IPs as two dimensional array, PORTS policy follows "row major order" and IPADDRS policy follows "column major order" while allocating port blocks.
		Example:
		Client IPs: 2.2.2.1, 2.2.2.2 and 2.2.2.3
		NAT IPs and PORT Blocks: 
		4.4.4.1:PB1, PB2, PB3,., PBn
		4.4.4.2: PB1, PB2, PB3,., PBn
		PORTS Policy: 
		2.2.2.1 => 4.4.4.1:PB1
		2.2.2.2 => 4.4.4.1:PB2
		2.2.2.3 => 4.4.4.1:PB3

		2.2.2.1 => 4.4.4.1:PB1
		2.2.2.2 => 4.4.4.2:PB1

		The ADC uses its existing syslog and audit log framework to log LSN information.

When the Logging parameter is enabled, the Citrix ADC generates log messages related to LSN mappings and LSN sessions of this LSN group. The ADC then sends these log messages to servers associated with the NSLOG action and SYSLOG actions entities.

		* NSIP address of the Citrix ADC
		* Time stamp
		* Entry type (MAPPING or SESSION)
		* Whether the LSN mapping entry is created or deleted
		* Subscriber's IP address, port, and traffic domain ID
		* NAT IP address and port

		** Destination IP address and port are not logged for Endpoint-Independent mapping
