	* Type of filter to apply to packets originating from external hosts.
		Consider an example of an LSN mapping that includes the mapping of subscriber IP:port (X:x), NAT IP:port (N:n), and external host IP:port (Y:y).
		Available options function as follows:
		* ENDPOINT INDEPENDENT - Filters out only packets not destined to the subscriber IP address and port X:x, regardless of the external host IP address and port source (Z:z).  The Citrix ADC forwards any packets destined to X:x.  In other words, sending packets from the subscriber to any external IP address is sufficient to allow packets from any external hosts to the subscriber.
		* ADDRESS DEPENDENT - Filters out packets not destined to subscriber IP address and port X:x.  In addition, the ADC filters out packets from Y:y destined for the subscriber (X:x) if the client has not previously sent packets to Y:anyport (external port independent). In other words, receiving packets from a specific external host requires that the subscriber first send packets to that specific external host's IP address.
		* ADDRESS PORT DEPENDENT (the default) - Filters out  packets not destined to subscriber IP address and port (X:x).  In addition, the Citrix ADC filters out packets from Y:y destined for the subscriber (X:x) if the subscriber has not previously sent packets to Y:y.  In other words, receiving packets from a specific external host requires that the subscriber first send packets first to that external IP address and port.
