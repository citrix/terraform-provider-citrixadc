		After the pool is created, these IPv4 addresses are added to the Citrix ADC as Citrix ADC owned IP address of type LSN. A maximum of 4096 IP addresses can be bound to an LSN pool. An LSN IP address associated with an LSN pool cannot be shared with other LSN pools. IP addresses specified for this parameter must not already exist on the Citrix ADC as any Citrix ADC owned IP addresses. In the command line interface, separate the range with a hyphen. For example: 10.102.29.30-10.102.29.189. You can later remove some or all the LSN IP addresses from the pool, and add IP addresses to the LSN pool.
		By default , arp is enabled on LSN IP address but, you can disable it using command - "set ns ip"
