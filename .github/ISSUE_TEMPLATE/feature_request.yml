        # Thank you for opening an feature request!

        This form is intended as a way to request feature for existing/new resources, data sources, or the provider itself. This may include requests such as adding additional arguments or attributes enabled by upstream API changes, additional validation for arguments, adding new resource or data-source etc.

        If the absense of the requested feature is causing unexpected behavior in the provider, the "Report a Bug" form should be used.

        If this request was implemented, what might the Terraform configuration look like? A best guess is helpful, even if you're unsure of exactly what the end result will look like. This helps maintainers and the community better understand how you (someone who is in need of this feature) envisions it.
